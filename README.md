Answers to the questions for the Spotify Challenge

Question 1a: I would create a Genre Table with the genre and index key only. This table would be a foriegn key in the Songs                    table.
Question 1b: This would be a one genre to many songs relationship.

Question 2: I think adding the Genre table as described will be the best way to handle the multiple genres per song. This method             should allow us to display multiple genres for each song with the least amount of space being used for the data.
